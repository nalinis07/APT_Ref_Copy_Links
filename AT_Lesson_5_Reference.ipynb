Most likely, due to poor internet speed, the Colab notebook might have lost the information that all the previous codes have been executed already. As a remedy, run codes in the code cells beginning from the first code cell till the $(k - 1)^{th}$ code cell. For e.g., if the code in the $5^{th}$ code cell fails to run because of one of the aforementioned errors, execute the codes in all the first four code cells again.\n",
